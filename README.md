## Description
The goal of this project is to focus on using express, which  is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. I can use localhost and show off my application. I don't need to show my application as a static website

## Installiations 
The following dependencies must be installed to run the application: Express, nodemon, heroku, uuid
## Usage
In order to use this app, Front end code was already given. We needed to create a server.js so that we can program the backend code and have servers. If you take a look at the server.js, you can see the variable dependencies, variables to set up the express app, app. get, post, use, and delete. These app. lines of code are the basic routes on how to get the index.html and notes.html and on saving, and deleting the notes in our note tracker app. We need a line of code to start the server and then begin to listen. (see line 47).

## Test
This following is needed to run a test: Type in your code on server.js. Then to see if the server is listening to your port, type in node server.js in the terminal. In the browser, type in http://localhost:3000. If your code is correct, then you should see the application being hosted. Then you need to test the functionality. You need to click the start button. There you will be taken to the notes.html and type in your notes. They should also save. You can then take look at the db.json file. Your notes should be saved in that file.
